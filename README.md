Welcome to the **Durable-style AI Website Builder** – a playful, developer-friendly clone of the rapid website creator you always wished existed. Give us a couple of details about your business and we'll hand back a polished, production-ready Next.js site, complete with images, copy, and design defaults.

## ✨ What's inside?

- **Next.js + React + TypeScript** – modern, typed, and blazingly fast.
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling with zero config.
- **AI content generation** – powered via `GROQ_API_KEY` (or swap in OpenAI if you like).
- **Image sourcing** – royalty-free photos pulled on-the-fly from Pexels (`PEXELS_API_KEY`).
- **Drag-and-drop section builder** – reorder, duplicate, or delete blocks.
- **One-click "Add Section"** – sits neatly between every block (à la Durable).
- **Live style panels** – tweak colors, spacing, and layout in real time.
- **Local storage autosave** – never lose your work when you refresh.
